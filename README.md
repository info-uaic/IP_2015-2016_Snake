## ---NEXUS SNAKE--- ##
This repository contains both the cpp source file and a release version of the project. 
The cpp can be found in Snake->Snake.cpp --- and the release can be found in Release->Snake.exe.
I apologise for the source file that is NOT very clean-code since I didn't start working on it with that aspect in mind and I didn't bother fixing that aspect of it afterwards.

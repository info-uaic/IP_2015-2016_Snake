## NEXUS SNAKE ##
This repository contains both the cpp source file and a release version of the project.     

The cpp can be found in Snake->Snake.cpp.   

The release can be found in Release->Snake.exe.      

I apologise for the source file that is NOT clean-code since I didn't start working on it with that aspect in mind and I didn't bother fixing that aspect of it afterwards.
